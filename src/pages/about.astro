    Hi! I'm Allison Cretel, an engineer and student at Shopify. I'm passionate
    about building innovative software solutions that make a real difference in
    people's lives. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in modern web
    technologies, distributed systems, and user experience design.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Shopify, I work on challenging engineering problems that help merchants
    around the world grow their businesses. From optimizing performance to
    building new features, every day brings exciting opportunities to learn and
    contribute to a platform that powers millions of businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey in technology started with a curiosity about how things work
    behind the scenes. That curiosity has led me to explore various areas of
    software engineering, from frontend development with React and TypeScript to
    backend systems with Ruby and Go. I'm particularly interested in the
    intersection of engineering and user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies through side
    projects, contributing to open source, or sharing what I've learned through
    blog posts and talks. I believe that the best way to grow as an engineer is
    to continuously learn, experiment, and help others along their journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm always excited to connect with fellow engineers, discuss interesting
    problems, and explore opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to reach
    out if you'd like to chat about technology, engineering at scale, or
    anything else that sparks your curiosity!
  </p>
